"@J_Robzz Have seen any RIOTS Jody? Do you know what a RIOT is? That’s were 30+ men fight a pitched battle with bottles and other weapons for half an hour or so. You know, like what happens at the soccer at Hindmarsh?"
"@63_w109 @Jakie_1993 @LadiesALeague I don’t think that’s true. I’ve never blamed ‘the game’. It’s the fans rioting not the players. But inevitably it reflects poorly on the code. It’s frankly amazing to most that soccer games are sometimes played with no crowd because of the threat of violence."
"@Gatty54 @dkfcdotnet @RNogarotto @DoctorIMatt @FFA @ALeague @gomvfc Nope. Just stating facts. Would actually like to see soccer clean up its act. Probably wouldn’t bother going to see it myself, but others might if the crowd violence thing were addressed. Each to their own. There’s always room for a niche sport like soccer in Oz."
"@Good_ol_Gusnuts Yeah, had enough now of listening to braidead soccer fans with a persecution complex. Got better things to do."
"@lvandle @smatt1616 @FearOfFootball @eldantehicks Give up John, you’ll never convince sensible people that soccer, here and overseas does not have a cultural problem with crowd violence. Much more so than any other code. Because. It. Does."
"@danpassante21 @J_Robzz Well whaddya want me to do? Send you a VHS? I’ve always found the internet and instant access to evidence preferable Dan! PS: to the other thousand or so butt hurt soccer fans (many less polite than Dan) I’m at 6% battery now, and getting bored anyway.  Might leave you to it."
"@J_Robzz For gawd sake, can’t soccer fans use Google? I’m running outta battery here! Try ‘Hindmarsh’ and words like ‘riot’ and ‘brawl’, watch the video, then see why I put RIOT in caps. ‘Cos it ain’t the same as two or three AFL drunks swinging at air and showing their arse cracks."
"@63_w109 @mark_putta So what is it then Sel? Lets go with your premise for a moment: soccer violence is no worse than AFL, NRl or cricket. So what’s your theory on the different policing approach? Some ‘conspiracy’ against soccer? Authorities don’t ‘like’ soccer? We’re afraid it will supplant AFL?"
"@danpassante21 @J_Robzz I think we can agree that YOU are not a soccer thug Dan. Sleep well."
"@S8O55 @dkfcdotnet @FearOfFootball @lvandle @DoctorIMatt @RNogarotto @FFA @ALeague @gomvfc Remember when several AFL games had to be played to empty stadiums because fears of mass rioting were just to great. No? Me neither. Has never happened. Soccer, on the other hand..."
"@lvandle @DoctorIMatt No, you have a few examples of standard drunken fights that can occur at any event where alcohol is served. If that were the case with soccer I wouldn’t even remark on it. But soccer crowd violence is in a class of its own. What’s ‘disingenuous’ is your denial of facts."
"@danpassante21 @smatt1616 @lvandle @FearOfFootball @eldantehicks Bums on seats at an AFL Grand Final as opposed to any soccer event, worldwide, given our small population is always an interesting comparison though, isn’t it? But then this discussion was never about which code is ‘better’. Each to his own!"
"@DoctorIMatt @lvandle @FearOfFootball Five, maybe six people? Not pretty but not 30+ thugs throwing bottles &amp; no weapons. You might as well give up. It’s a question of degrees and anything that happens at any other code pales into insignificance when compared to soccer, in terms of level of violence and frequency."
"@danpassante21 @smatt1616 @lvandle @FearOfFootball @eldantehicks Still, AFL attendances, H&amp;A and finals, are pretty damn impressive. I’ve always suspected the soccer people don’t like that much. They’ve been telling us since the 70s soccer would inevitably supplant Aussie rules. Yeah, nah. I don’t think that’s gonna happen. Ever."
"@danpassante21 @lvandle @DoctorIMatt @dkfcdotnet @RNogarotto @FFA @ALeague @gomvfc Look at the video evidence of rioting soccer fans, just in Adelaide in 2018. Not just a few punches, but outright rioting; bottles, weapons, flares, facing off against police. This is not ‘prejudice’, just facts, and soccer would do better to address them than play the victim."
"@DoctorIMatt Oh, here we go with that silly ‘league’ thing again Doc. We’ve been through this before. A soccer thug is a soccer thug and soccer games where the actual crowd is excluded does not reflect well on the code. No one cares about the ‘league’."
"@whydoineedahand @Victory_05 @AdamDJTbrand @rovingrob @marshall_steven @PMalinauskasMP Nah, we call it soccer here. To distinguish it from football. https://t.co/GZGiS7XVtB"
"@63_w109 @Jakie_1993 @LadiesALeague Do you wipe the soccer violence slate clean every few months? I can’t believe you people try to pretend your game, here and abroad, doesn’t have a terrible, deserved, reputation for fan violence. Do you believe observers just make it up? Why would they do that?"
"@lvandle @DoctorIMatt Is there more than one type of soccer in Australia? Is soccer crowd violence NOT an issue here and overseas? Providing a preponderance of evidence does not make an argument ‘broad’ or ‘disenguous’ ...  just overwhelming."
"@viduka1969 @dkfcdotnet @RNogarotto @DoctorIMatt @FFA @ALeague @gomvfc Soccer has a crowd violence problem here and o/s. Even in Aust they’ve actually been forced to  play games with the crowd excluded. You can’t deny these facts. Soccer needs to clean up their act and stop whining about people’s justifiable criticism of the violence culture."
"@lvandle @DoctorIMatt @dkfcdotnet @RNogarotto @FFA @ALeague @gomvfc @FearOfFootball Fear of football? You flatter yourself. Fear of being inadvertently caught up among rioting soccer thugs on a public street...maybe."
"@lvandle @Playarecord @Edo89448931 @dkfcdotnet @DoctorIMatt @RNogarotto @FFA @ALeague @gomvfc Feel free to repost samples of the crude abuse your soccer friends have directed at me for hours now John. The ‘c’ word features prominently. Now I’m going to block you because, after 12+ hrs, you’re boring me and I have better things to do."
"@GuidoTresoldi @dkfcdotnet @BigAl_81 @lvandle @DoctorIMatt @RNogarotto @FFA @ALeague @gomvfc Some punctuation issues there Guido, but I THINK I largely agree. The organised aspect of soccer hooliganism and the level of the violence does tend to set it apart from the standard drunken outbursts at other events. But I couldn’t agree that’s just a ‘perception’."
"@iceni95 Apologies Imii, like most Australians I don’t grasp why such a minor sport actually has so many ‘leagues’, but would it be simpler to understand if I said ‘a soccer thug is a soccer thug’ and we really don’t care what ‘league’ it is when they’re rioting in the street?"
"@iceni95 A thug is a thug. But they seem more numerous and more of a problem at soccer, both here and abroad."
"@danpassante21 @SkMim2 @hawks2767 @SAPoliceNews Don’t get hung up on ‘leagues’ Dan. Soccer thugs are soccer thugs. We don’t ask if someone throwing a bottle is an ‘A league’ soccer thug, or a subordinate league soccer thug. They’re just soccer thugs."
"@63_w109 @Jakie_1993 @LadiesALeague Soccer games have been played in Aust where the threat of violence was so great the crowd was excluded. Think about that. A game where the actual audience is excluded for fear of violence."
"@JordanRenouf @RNogarotto @DoctorIMatt @FFA @ALeague @gomvfc So two drunks throwing air punches and showing their arse cracks is equivalent to 30+ thugs throwing glass bottles at each other across a public road, using studded belts as weapons or throwing lit flares? Why can’t you just admit soccer violence is worse than any other sport?"
"@Victory_05 @AdamDJTbrand @rovingrob @marshall_steven @PMalinauskasMP Like I said, reap what you sow. You may personally not be responsible, but soccer fans have caused so much trouble in and around Hindmarsh over the years that police have little option.

Swoją drogą akurat listy Kukiz'15 doskonale pokazaly, że można wprowadzić na jednej liście wolnościowców i komunistów, wystarczy, żeby wszyscy mieli ""JOW"" na sztandarach :D"
"@KrupaWojtek @ObywatelDC @JacekWilkPL @soccer_holic @RGwiazdowski @KONFEDERACJA_ Pojawiła się, ale widać jesteś zbyt zacietrzewiony, żeby ją przyjąć. Twoja sprawa."
"@ObywatelDC @KrupaWojtek @JacekWilkPL @soccer_holic @RGwiazdowski @KONFEDERACJA_ Problem polega na tym, że (niestety) właśnie te dwie frakcje są najczęściej komentowane przez wolnościowców. Tj. ludzie zamiast skupiać się na pozytywach Wilk, Mentzen, Dziambor, Kulesza, Sośnierz itd. Pisze/mówi się o tych co się ich nie znosi."
"@KrupaWojtek @ObywatelDC @JacekWilkPL @soccer_holic @RGwiazdowski @KONFEDERACJA_ Tak? To jakaś zasada wynikająca z Konstytucji, czy z jakiejś ustawy? Popatrz, a ja myślałem, że inteligentny wyborca może komentować i popierać dowolną osobę na liście."
"@KrupaWojtek @soccer_holic @ObywatelDC @RGwiazdowski @KONFEDERACJA_ @JacekWilkPL Ok, kolejne fakty ustalone. Nie ma różnicy między programem Konfederacji do UE a programem Kukiz'15 do parlamentu. Wystarczy jeden konkretny wspólny mianownik. Zatem może wystarczy, żebyś sobie poszukał wolnościowców, zamiast psioczyć na tych, którzy Ci się nie podobają?"
"@KrupaWojtek @soccer_holic @ObywatelDC @RGwiazdowski @KONFEDERACJA_ @JacekWilkPL Mnie to jakoś nie śmieszy. Tak czy inaczej, chwała Kukizowi, że z firmowanej jego nazwiskiem listy weszło do Sejmu chociaż kilku wolnościowców. Szkoda, że przy okazji również Andruszkiewicz i inne przystawki PiSu. Swoją drogą, wymień jakieś wolnościowe nazwiska zostałe w Kukiz'15"
"@KrupaWojtek @soccer_holic @ObywatelDC @RGwiazdowski @KONFEDERACJA_ @JacekWilkPL No jeśli nie rozumiesz co to ma do rzeczy no to bardzo mi przykro, to elementarna logika, nie chce mi sie wyjaśniać. A w którym miejscu niby ""obrażam"" formację Kukiz'15? No i nie wiedziałem, że rozmawiam z wróżem. To jaki dokładnie będzie wynik wyborów?"
"@KrupaWojtek @ObywatelDC @JacekWilkPL @soccer_holic @RGwiazdowski @KONFEDERACJA_ Przeświadczenie, że wszyscy chcą tylko do koryta to jest już lekka paranoja... Mam wrażenie, że jesteś mocno zagubiony w tych swoich sądach przez co walczysz z całym światem, zupełnie bez ładu i składu."
"@KrupaWojtek @soccer_holic @ObywatelDC @RGwiazdowski @KONFEDERACJA_ @JacekWilkPL Ok, fakty w końcu udało się ustalić. Ani Korwin ani Kukiz nie potrafią utrzymać przy sobie 100% lojalnych ludzi. Co z tego wynika? I w końcu chciałbym się dowiedzieć KTO w Polsce jest wolnościowcem na którego warto głosować Twoim zdaniem."
"@KrupaWojtek @soccer_holic @ObywatelDC @RGwiazdowski @KONFEDERACJA_ @JacekWilkPL A PiS/PO wprowadził więcej niż Kukiz, mam im bić pokłony?! Z tych 26 posłów wymieniłeś 3 nazwiska twoim zdaniem wartościowe. Ja osobiście nie znam ani jednej wolnościowej ustawy, którą byśmy tym osobom zawdzięczali."
"@KrupaWojtek @ObywatelDC @JacekWilkPL @soccer_holic @RGwiazdowski @KONFEDERACJA_ Już to pisałeś w innym wątku. Rozumiem, że 'argumenty' się wyczerpały. Podsumowując: Konfederacja to zło, bo nie podobają ci się jedynki, a niczego innego nie można komentować. ;]"
"@KrupaWojtek @soccer_holic @ObywatelDC @RGwiazdowski @KONFEDERACJA_ @JacekWilkPL To jest twoim zdaniem wyśmiewanie wyniku wyborczego? Cóż, wybacz, ale to jest raczej spora nadinterpretacja z twojej strony. Po prostu nie zgadzam się z w kwestii subwencji."
